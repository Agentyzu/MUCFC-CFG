# MUCFC-CFG Algorithm
Python code for implementing a MUCFC-CFG algorithm

# What does this do?
The MUCFC-CFG algorithm is proposed based on coalition formation game, and it can achieve stable coalition division through multiple iterations. In the multi-UAV coalition formation problem, we solve the problem driven by the task by the MUCFC-CFG algorithm.

# How do I use this?
Check out `config.ini` for input instructions. In this example, we create a text file that lists the initialized properties, including the number of UAVs, the number of tasks, the number of iteration rounds, the alpha value, and other parameters.

Then run the Python code. If you are running Linux, this is super easy. Change to the directory and:

    $ ./Main.py 

This will also work (and maybe even work on Windows/OSX?):

    $ python3 Main.py

If you are using Pycharm or IDLE or whatever else, You can double-click to open `Main.py` and run it directly.
